# KODE CLUB – Competitive Programming

## Getting Started Guide

1. Learn the basics of any programming language.  
   **C++ is preferred** for Competitive Programming.

2. Learn basic **Mathematics concepts**.

3. Start learning and set up a **code editor**.  
   **Sublime Text** is a plus for Competitive Programming.

4. Begin with **basic problems**.  
   Start solving **800-rated problems on Codeforces**.

5. Follow the **TLE Sheet** if you like:  
   👉 https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet

6. Follow the **CSES Problem Set** for better understanding of  
   **Data Structures and Algorithms**:  
   👉 https://cses.fi/problemset/  
   CSES contains basic and fixed algorithm-based questions.  
   These problems are **benchmark problems** for other CP problems.

7. Follow the **USACO Guide** (better platform for learning basic  
   Data Structures and Algorithms):  
   👉 https://usaco.guide/general/resources-cp?lang=cpp  
   **OR** follow **Striver’s A2Z Sheet** for core DSA:  
   👉 https://takeuforward.org/dsa/strivers-a2z-sheet-learn-dsa-a-to-z

8. Follow **CP by Luv** playlist for DSA concepts:

Give contest reguarly on codeforces, codechef, Atcoder and Leetcode.

Mostly contest solution available online use them.

Follow CP Handbook.
